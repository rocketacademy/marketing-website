        Kai studied Computer Science at Stanford and served as a CS teaching
        assistant. He has worked at Facebook, Alibaba, Nuna Health, and Dana
        Cita in San Francisco, New York, Singapore, and Jakarta.

        Kai started Rocket Academy after experiencing the industry-wide shortage of good software engineers. Rocket’s 6-month full time Bootcamp is a middle ground between long and expensive university courses and short and insufficient 12-week software engineering bootcamps.
