        3. Rocket is led by software engineers from top schools and companies such as Stanford, Cambridge and Facebook that have strong connections to the tech industry.
    - question: Why choose Rocket's courses over other coding bootcamps?
      answers: >-
        1. Rocket offers a more comprehensive Coding Bootcamp course, covering
        app development and algorithms, with full time (4 months) and part time
        (8 months) options.

        2. We have a high-calibre alumni network, driven by selective admissions that screens upfront for coding aptitude and communication skills.

    - question: Why choose Rocket over self-learning?
      answers: >
        1. Rocket provides a structured and guided path to getting a coding job
        in a fixed amount of time.

        2. Rocket exposes you to software engineers in industry on a regular basis to grow your network.

        3. Rocket provides a powerful network of peers and alumni that you can draw on for your future career.
    - question: Does Rocket offer in-person classes?
      answers: >-
        1. Rocket has no physical campus and conducts classes over Zoom and
        Slack. This helps reduce course fees and commute time, while still
        achieving the best coding bootcamp outcomes.

        2. Students code together daily over video call and group chat. There are fewer than 10 students per instructor, enabling interactive classes where students ask questions and get feedback.
    - question: How is Rocket different from online courses?
      answers: >-
        1. Rocket Academy's coding bootcamp course is live and cohort-based.
        Students ask questions in class daily and enjoy a community of
        classmates learning at the same pace.

        2. Rocket Academy cultivates a strong alumni network that significantly helps graduates with their careers.
    - question:
        What is the difference between software engineering, programming, and
        coding?
      answers: There is no practical difference. Software engineering is a
        professional term describing strong proficiency in following a
        systematic process of understanding requirements, working effectively
        with stakeholders, and developing a solution that fulfils their needs.
    - question:
        What is the difference between software engineering, data science, and
        data analytics?
      answers: >-
        1. Software engineers build apps and the underlying “pipes” for data to
        flow through. There are many parts of software to work on, hence the
        greater demand for software roles than data roles.

        2. Data scientists build statistical models to improve products, for example to make spam classifications, product recommendations, or match drivers and riders. Data scientists typically do the math, and software engineers build the product.

        3. Data analysts derive business insights through querying data and generating reports. This is typically a less skill-intensive job that more people can do, hence there is a comparatively lower average compensation and job security than software engineer and data scientist roles.
    - question: Do I need a Computer Science degree or diploma to be a software engineer?
      answers: >-
        1. 100% of Rocket Academy’s graduates do not have CS degrees or
        diplomas, and 100% are employed as software engineers.

        2. Rocket Academy has had successful graduates from unrelated fields like cooking and horse racing.

        3. Coding Bootcamps exist because universities are unable to produce enough engineers. Companies will hire great engineers, regardless of professional qualifications.
    - question: I’m bad at math. Can I be a software engineer?
      answers: |
        1. Math is not a pre-requisite for coding but logical thinking is.

        2. We believe anyone can coding given sufficient time and determination.

        3. If you’re unsure whether coding is for you, try Coding Basics!
    - question:
        I’ve tried coding but find it difficult. Can I still be a software
        engineer?
      answers: >-
        1. It is normal to find coding challenging - this is common among all
        software engineers. If you’re wondering whether you’re struggling more
        than normal, try Coding Basics.

        2. Rocket Academy provides on-demand support to students over group chat. We ask students to ask for help if they’re stuck for longer than 15 minutes, such that they do not spend too much time on relatively straightforward problems.

        3. Rocket Academy fosters a tight-knit community of learners that help each other. You will always have peers working through the same material that you can work together with and get help from. With time, you will learn.
    - question: I can code but struggle to get a job. Should I still join Rocket Academy?
      answers: >-
        1. If you already code but need help getting a software job, chat with
        us and we can advise whether self-studying or joining a course is
        appropriate.

        2. If you already have some prior experience/knowledge in coding and would like to join Rocket's Coding Bootcamp program, we may waive the Coding Basics requirement - reach out to us at hello at rocketacademy.co to find out more!

        3. Many of our most successful graduates have had prior coding experience before joining Rocket. Our Coding Bootcamp then provided them with the conceptual foundations, interview prep, and professional network they needed to complete their career switch.
    - question: Can I join Rocket’s courses while working a full-time job?
      answers: >-
        1. Coding Bootcamp has both full-time and part-time
        options.

        2. Full-Time Coding Bootcamp requires students to commit 10am-6pm SGT Mon-Fri for 4 months. We discourage working a full-time job while enrolled in the full-time Coding Bootcamp.

        3. Part-Time Coding Bootcamp requires students to commit 7.30-9.30pm SGT Tuesday evenings, and 10am-12pm SGT Saturday mornings, with roughly 20 hours of work per week for 8 months.
    - question: How many classes can I miss?
      answers: >-
        1. Classes are mandatory, live Zoom meetings where we review and
        solidify concepts through discussion and exercises.

        2. There is no strict attendance requirement for Rocket’s coding courses, but students who are not performing will be removed from their course.

        3. If you need to miss class for any reason, please let your instructor know ahead of time.
    - question: How much do Rocket Academy's courses cost?
      answers: >-

  questions:
    - question: What languages will I learn in Basics?
      answers: >
        1. Rocket’s courses focus on teaching coding concepts, not languages.
        This is because coding concepts are applicable to all languages, but
        language syntax may only be relevant to that specific language.

        2. Rocket teaches Coding Basics in JavaScript, currently the world’s most popular language. Basics coding concepts are relevant to almost all programming languages used today.
    - question: Will Basics teach me to code in React or Redux?
      answers: >
        1. Coding Basics teaches basic coding syntax, tools, and computational
        thinking, and not advanced frameworks such as React or Redux.

        2. The concepts we learn in Basics will give students the foundation to better harness frameworks such as React or Redux during Coding Bootcamp.
    - question: Will Basics teach me how to make a website?
      answers:
        Coding Basics teaches basic coding syntax, tools, and computational
        thinking, not web development. Rocket accepts top Basics students into
        our Coding Bootcamp where we dive deeper into web and
        general application development.
