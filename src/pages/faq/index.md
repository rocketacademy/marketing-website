  questions:
    - question: Why choose Rocket’s Basics course?
      answers: >-
        1. Basics is a pathway course, enabling top graduates to enrol in
        Rocket’s software engineering bootcamp should they wish to switch
        careers or learn professional coding.

        2. Basics has been taken and recommended by students from top tech companies such as Facebook, Stripe, Grab, Shopee, Rakuten, Ninja Van, McKinsey, and more.

        3. Basics is free.
    - question: Why choose Rocket’s Bootcamp course?
      answers: >-
        1. Rocket’s past students received offers from companies such as
        GovTech, Ninja Van, Xfers, 99.co, Glints, and more.

        2. Rocket’s Bootcamp is longer, comprehensively covering topics in frontend, backend, cloud, and algorithms that other bootcamps typically skim over, resulting in a more standout portfolio.

        3. Rocket’s Bootcamp only accepts top students, guaranteeing a strong network of classmates and alumni.
    - question: Why choose Rocket over university or polytechnic courses?
      answers: >
        1. Rocket is project-based, not exam-based. You will graduate with a
        standout portfolio.


        2. Rocket offers unlimited interview prep and referrals to tech companies, often overlooked by academic programmes.


        3. Rocket is led by software engineers from top schools and companies such as Stanford, Cambridge and Facebook that have strong connections to the tech industry.
    - question: Why choose Rocket over self-learning?
      answers: >
        1. Rocket provides a structured and guided path to getting a coding job
        in a fixed amount of time.

        2. Rocket exposes you to software engineers in industry on a regular basis to grow your network.

        3. Rocket provides a powerful network of peers and alumni that you can draw on for your future career.
    - question: Does Rocket offer in-person classes?
      answers: >-
        1. Rocket has no physical campus and conducts classes over Zoom and
        Slack. This helps reduce course fees and commute time, while still
        achieving the best bootcamp outcomes in Singapore.

        2. Students code together daily over video call and group chat. There are fewer than 10 students per instructor, enabling interactive classes where students ask questions and get feedback.
    - question: How is Rocket different from online courses?
      answers: >
        1. Rocket Academy is live and cohort-based. Students ask questions in
        class daily and enjoy a community of classmates learning at the same
        pace.

        2. Rocket Academy cultivates a strong alumni network that significantly helps graduates with their careers.
    - question: What is the difference between software engineering, programming, and
        coding?
      answers: There is no practical difference. Software engineering is a
        professional term describing strong proficiency in following a
        systematic process of understanding requirements, working effectively
        with stakeholders, and developing a solution that fulfils their needs.
    - question: What is the difference between software engineering, data science, and
        data analytics?
      answers: >-
        1. Software engineers build apps and the underlying “pipes” for data to
        flow through. There are many parts of software to work on, hence the
        greater demand for software roles than data roles.

        2. Data scientists build statistical models to improve products, for example to make spam classifications, product recommendations, or match drivers and riders. Data scientists typically do the math, and software engineers build the product.

        3. Data analysts derive business insights through querying data and generating reports. This is typically a less skill-intensive job that more people can do, hence there is a comparatively lower average compensation and job security than software engineer and data scientist roles.
    - question: Do I need a Computer Science degree or diploma to be a software engineer?
      answers: >
        1. 100% of Rocket Academy’s graduates do not have CS degrees or
        diplomas, and 100% are employed as software engineers.

        2. Rocket Academy has even had successful graduates from unrelated fields like cooking and horse racing.

        3. Bootcamps exist because universities are unable to produce enough engineers. Companies will hire great engineers, degree or not.
    - question: I’m bad at math. Can I be a software engineer?
      answers: |
        1. Math is not a pre-requisite for coding but logical thinking is.
        2. We believe anyone can coding given sufficient time and determination.
        3. If you’re unsure whether coding is for you, try Coding Basics!
    - question: I’ve tried coding but find it difficult. Can I still be a software
        engineer?
      answers: >
        1. It is normal to find coding challenging - this common among all
        software engineers. If you’re wondering whether you’re struggling more
        than normal, try Coding Basics.

        2. Rocket Academy provides on-demand support to students over group chat. We ask students to ask for help if they’re stuck for longer than 15 minutes, such that they do not spend too much time on relatively straightforward problems.

        3. Rocket Academy fosters a tight-knit community of learners that help each other. You will always have peers working through the same material that you can work together with and get help from. With time, you will learn.
    - question: I can code but struggle to get a job. Should I still join Rocket Academy?
      answers: >
        1. If you already code but need help getting a software job, chat with
        us and we can advise whether self-studying or joining a course is
        appropriate.

        2. If you already code and join Rocket, we may waive the Coding Basics requirement depending on your experience.

        3. Many of our most successful graduates had coding experience prior to joining Rocket. Software Engineering Bootcamp provided them with the conceptual foundations, interview prep, and professional network they needed to complete their career switch.
    - question: Can I join Rocket’s courses while working a full-time job?
      answers: >
        1. Coding Basics is Rocket’s introductory course and a pre-requisite for
        Software Engineering Bootcamp. Basics is a part-time course, roughly 10
        hours of work per week, and meets from 7-9pm on Tuesday evenings and
        1-3pm on Saturday afternoons.

        2. Software Engineering Bootcamp has both full-time and part-time options.


        1. Full-Time Bootcamp requires students to commit 10am-6pm SGT Mon-Fri for 24 weeks. We discourage working a full-time job while enrolled in the full-time Bootcamp.


        2. Part-Time Bootcamp requires students to commit 7.30-9.30pm SGT Tuesday evenings, and 10am-12pm SGT Saturday mornings, with roughly 20 hours of work per week for 48 weeks.
    - question: How many classes can I miss?
      answers: >
        1. Classes are mandatory, live Zoom meetings where we review and
        solidify concepts through discussion and exercises.

        2. There is no strict attendance requirement for Rocket’s courses, but students that are not performing will be removed from their course.

        3. If you need to miss class for any reason, please let your instructor know ahead of time.
    - question: What payment plans do you offer?
      answers: >
        1. Coding Basics is currently free for all interested students. Apply
        now!

        2. Software Engineering Bootcamp tuition is payable upfront.

  questions:
    - question: What languages will I learn in Basics?
      answers: >
        1. Rocket’s courses focus on teaching coding concepts, not languages.
        This is because coding concepts are applicable to all languages, but
        language syntax may only be relevant to that specific language.

        2. Rocket teaches Coding Basics in JavaScript, currently the world’s most popular language. Basics coding concepts are relevant to almost all programming languages used today.
    - question: Will Basics teach me to code in React or Redux?
      answers: >
        1. Coding Basics teaches basic coding syntax, tools, and computational
        thinking, and not advanced frameworks such as React or Redux.

        2. The concepts we learn in Basics will give students the foundation to better harness frameworks such as React or Redux during Software Engineering Bootcamp.
    - question: Will Basics teach me how to make a website?
      answers: Coding Basics teaches basic coding syntax, tools, and computational
        thinking, not web development. Rocket accepts top Basics graduates to
        Software Engineering Bootcamp where we dive deeper into web and general
        application development.
